# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [4.6.0] - 2018-11-09
### Added
- The input variable `lreadbondcl` in `nmlParticle` is introduced. It is a flag for reading cross-linking information when `txstart=zero`.
### Fixed
- The problem that the crosslinks are not set in non-hierarchical structures if `txstart='zero'`- is fixed. The informations about crosslinking in the .cnf-file are read in the variable `bondcl` if `lreadbondcl=.true.`.

## [4.5.4] - 2018-11-08
### Fixed
- Changed the maximum number of cross-links of chain particles in a network to `nbondcl = 2` to allow for the simulation of networks with one particle per chain.

## [4.5.3] - 2018-11-07
### Fixed
- A check has been implemented in subroutine `SetNetwork` to prevent networks to interpenetrate.

## [4.5.2] - 2018-11-06
### Changed
- Subroutine `FileOpen` was modernized with regards to its usage of the `open` function
- Before, an `append` state of files was achieved by "manually" playing forward
- Now, the `append` state is explicitly achieved by using the `position` keyword of the `open` function

## [4.5.1] - 2018-10-30
### Fixed
- Prevented the dumping of the charged state for systems without weak charges

## [4.5.0] - 2018-09-24
### Added
- A manual generating by Doxygen was added. For that reason the code was newly commented. Some files concerning the manual were added in the directory doc to the  repository.
### Changed
- The calculation of the radius of gyration of the hierarchical structures was improved. In detail:
 - Now the root mean squared radius of gyration is calculated, before it was the mean absolute radius of gyration
 - The possibility to calculate the radius of gyration in the case of multiple hierarchical structures is added
- Read `bondcl` only when using continue, not for zero
- The Repository was moved to github

## [4.4.0] - 2018-01-03
### Fixed
- the variable `nvar` is set correctly for `chaindf`. This was not the case before (when `lhierarchical = .true.`), resulting in division by zero for the uninitialized positions in the `var` array in `DistFuncSamp â–ºle`.
- Compatibility issues with gfortran 4.8 were fixed
- The way the configure script determines which compiler to use is improved.
**NOTE** You have rerun the configure script when upgrading to this version
- The calculation of the cellsize in the case that a cell is as wide as the box is fixed.
- Some makefile dependencies are fixed
### Added
- a framework to give explicitly the random number seeds was added
### Changed
- the random number seeds are given in the output file
- `ntrydef`, the number of tries to set a configuration, is now an input parameter
- The makefile now has the binary executable as the ultimate target, so that make only runs when it is really of use

## [4.3.2] - 2017-08-23
### Fixed
- the speed of creating the celllist was increased, to have a more efficient method of carrying out npt calculations
- the periodic boundary conditions of `PBC` work also if the coordinates are more than one cell away
- when setting chains on a lattice, and the creation of the configuration for one chain fails, it tries again on the same lattice point, and not on the next one
- if the distance is smaller than `r2umin` and also smaller than `radatat` then it is treated as an hard core overlap
### Added
- added a `gprof` mode to the `gfortran` compilation to allow for profiling with `gprof`

## [4.3.1] - 2017-08-23
### Fixed
- fixed reading of variables from ucnf file, as the parameter have changed with version 2.2.0

### Added
